## Exercises 

1. Add a TextView widget to our app layout that reports to the user what API level the device is running. 

(You cannot set this TextView's text in the layout because you will not know the device's build version until runtime. Find the TextView method for setting text in the TextView reference page in Android's documentation. You are looking for a method that accepts a single argument - a string (or a CharSequence) 

Use other XML attributes listed in the TextView reference to adjust the size or typeface of the text.)
