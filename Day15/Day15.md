## Exercises & ToDo 

1. Making List items Dynamic
- Now that the layout includes the right constraints, update the ImageView so that the handcuffs are only shown on crimes that have been solved.

2. Formatting the Date
- The Date object is more of a timestamp than a conventional date. A timestamp is what you see when you call toString() on a Date, so that is what you have on in each of your RecyclerView rows. While timestamps make for good documentation, it might be nicer if the rows just displayed the date as humans think of it - like "June 6, 2017". You can do this with an instance of the android.text.format.DateFormat class. The place to start is the reference page for this class in the Android documentation.

You can use methods in the DateFormat class to get a common format. Or you can prepare your own format string.
